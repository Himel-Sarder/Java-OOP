Reflection in Java allows you to inspect and modify classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime. It provides a way to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications. 
Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class that can be executed by using the object.
Through reflection, we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.
