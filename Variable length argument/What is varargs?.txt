In Java, variable-length arguments (varargs) allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a method. This feature simplifies method invocation when you need to pass an unspecified number of arguments of the same type to a method. 
Here's how you can define and use variable-length arguments in Java:

Syntax
To define a method with variable-length arguments, use an ellipsis (...) after the parameter type. Inside the method, the varargs parameter is treated as an array of the specified type.


public void methodName(Type... parameterName) {
    // Method body
}


Key Points
Varargs must be the last parameter in the method's parameter list.
You can have at most one varargs parameter in a method.
If you need to pass additional parameters along with varargs, those must be defined before the varargs parameter.
When to Use Varargs
Varargs are useful when you want to provide flexibility in the number of arguments passed to a method. Common use cases include utility methods like formatting or processing collections of objects where the exact number of elements isn't known beforehand.

Understanding varargs in Java allows you to create more flexible and expressive APIs without needing to define multiple overloaded methods for different numbers of arguments.
