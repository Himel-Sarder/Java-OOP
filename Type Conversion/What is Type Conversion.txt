Programs perform operations and calculations which may or may not involve variables of different data types. Compatible data types do not cause problems during execution. 
However, incompatible ones need to be cast or converted explicitly. Each data type is assigned a certain memory space to store its value, so if variables of different types are involved, 
finding the data type of the result is uncertain. Thus, types conversion is of two types.

- Widening or implicit Conversion
- Narrowing  or explicit Conversion

It is important to note here that conversion between two primitive and two non-primitive data types is only possible. 
We cannot typecast a primitive to a non-primitive data type and vice versa. Implicit and explicit type conversions are performed based on a precedence structure where data types are arranged in a particular order.
